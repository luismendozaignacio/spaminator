# spaminator
Friends giving you a hard time? Your loved one isn't paying attention to you? Are you just bored? Presenting the Spaminator, spam your friends on iMessages for as long as you want. Disclaimer: You are responsible for everything you type and for the amount of spam. Make sure the person you are spamming is okay with it. <br />
<br />
To run the code Download the following: <br />
Latest version of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br />
Pip3:  on terminal type: python3 get-pip.py <br />
Install PyAutoGui: on terminal type: python3 -m pip install pyautogui <br />
Give permission to Terminal: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility -> Terminal <br />
<br />
TEST SPAMINATOR FIRST <br />
By default when you run Spaminator it will open a testTxt.txt file so you can test the software first before opening iMessages. <br />
Mess around with it to get a feel and see what you can do. Once you run the program make sure not to move your mouse or click somewhere else as it will start typing on any app that is currently opened. Let Spaminator do it's thing and it will let you know what it is doing on the terminal. <br /> 
<br />
The REAL THING 
<br />
This is a work in progress software so as of right now there are two ways you can open iMessages <br />
#1 have iMessages convesation of the intended recipient open before running Spaminator <br /> 
#2 if your intended recipient is the most recent conversation in iMessage, Spaminator may open iMessage automatically. <br />
Then go to main.py and comment lines 15 & 35  <br />
Uncomment lines 16 & 36 <br />
As a safety spam mechanism, by default the max number of spam you can do is 10. If you want to change it then comment line 32 on main.py

<br />
Finally go to the Spaminator folder on terminal and type python3 main.py to run Spaminator. <br />
Once again, make sure the person you are going to spam is okay with it and do not over do it.
